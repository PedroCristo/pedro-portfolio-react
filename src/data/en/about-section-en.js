        After working for a printing company in Lisbon for 14 years, I discovered the
        exciting field of Graphic Design. While in Ireland, I've had the opportunity to
        learn coding and programming languages such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, as well
        as web design tools like Bootstrap and jQuery frameworks. I am currently working as a
        freelance developer and specialize in Front End templates and building WordPress web 
        applicationsusing these frameworks. In October 2021, I started a Full-stack course at 
        Code Institute and during this time I gained additional tools to enhance my developer 
        skills and graduated in December 2022. Additionally, last October, I had the opportunity 
        to join a project in India as a front-end developer and designer, collaborating with a 
        professional team. This experience has been amazing and during this project, I started to 
        learn the React framework which has been a fantastic professional experience.`,
